  "<p>In crowded markets, being different isn‚Äôt enough. You have to communicate how you‚Äôre different.

Messaging that stands out starts with understanding what your audience hates about the current options and then owning the opposite. The brands that win don‚Äôt just have better products. They have better words. So how do you find the messag...",

  "<p>Southwest Airlines built one of the strongest brands in the world by doing one thing better than almost anyone: clear, clever messaging that made customers feel like family. ‚ÄúBags fly free‚Äù was more than a tagline.
