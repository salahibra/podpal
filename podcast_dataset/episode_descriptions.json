  "Attention is the name of the game in today’s market. If you want to stand out, you need to move fast, think creatively, and tap into what your audience is already talking about. Whether it’s a funny meme, a strategic shoutout, or a well-timed post, the brands that win know how to seize the moment and jump into the spotlight. So how do you identify those moments and use them without sounding corny or out of touch? <p> </p> In this week’s episode, Don and Kyle unpack the power of real-time marketing using Nike’s viral Scottie Scheffler...",
  "<p>In crowded markets, being different isn’t enough. You have to communicate how you’re different. Too many businesses blend in because they focus on what the competition is doing instead of what customers actually care about. You might offer better pricing, better service, or a better product, but if you don’t say it clearly, it won’t matter. Messaging that stands out starts with understanding what your audience hates about the current options and then owning the opposite. The brands that win don’t just have better products. They have better words. So how do you find the messag...",
  "Coming up with a product name or tagline seems simple. Until you have to do it. You brainstorm, you debate, and you finally land on something… only to find yourself explaining it to people over and over. That’s the real test of a name: if you have to explain it, it’s not working. The truth is, your name or tagline is doing more heavy lifting than you realize. It’s your first impression, elevator pitch, and clearest hook all rolled into a few words. So why do some names work instantly while others fall flat? And how do you make...",
  "It’s not enough to have a great product. You have to position it so customers instantly understand the value. That’s what separates the brands that break through from the ones that disappear. Magic Spoon didn’t invent cereal, they just told a better story: one where protein replaces sugar, and taste isn’t sacrificed for health. And they did it with a smart tagline, a well-defined villain, and a brand voice that made people pay attention. So how can you sharpen your positioning to you stand out like they did? <p> </p> In this episode, Don and Kyle break dow...",
  "<p>Southwest Airlines built one of the strongest brands in the world by doing one thing better than almost anyone: clear, clever messaging that made customers feel like family. “Bags fly free” was more than a tagline. It was a promise that set them apart from every other airline. But when they recently backtracked on that core message, the backlash was instant. In a world where loyalty is fragile and expectations are sky-high, even the best brands can stumble if they don’t communicate the right way. So what happens when a company known for brilliant messaging gets it wrong?</p> <p...",
